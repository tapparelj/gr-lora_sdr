# v0.5.6
- Added tagged stream input support (for frame definition of frame length)
- Fixed LLR stream format between _fft\_demod_ and _deinterleaver_ 
# v0.5.5
- added tags to crc verification output stream indication frame start, length and CRC result.
# v0.5.4
- added separator option for file input
# v0.5.3
- added parameter for preamble length
# v0.5.2
- added parameter for frame zero-padding

# v0.5.1
- Fixed an issue when running simulations on multiple threads while using soft-decision decoding

# v0.5.0
- add low datarate optimisation support
    - Can be enabled, disabled or used automatically for configuration using symbols longer than 16ms
    - Compatible with semtech transceiver (verified with semtech sx1276)
- add support of spreading factors smaller than 7
    - Compatible with semtech transceiver (verified with semtech sx1276)
- add sampling frequency offset estimation and compensation
    - Estimation leverages the relation between CFO and SFO, both caused by the same reference clock
    - The compensation method consists in a two step refinement of the estimates in the preamble and a puncturing/insertion of samples during the payload
- Add PRR simulation script in apps/
- Simplify spreading factor setup in receiver 

# v0.4.0
- Port to GNU Radio 3.10
- Added hierarchical blocks for easy Tx and Rx utilisation
- fixed issue with buffer sizes for spreading factor 12
- move sample flowgraphs from apps to examples

# v0.3.0
- Added soft-decision decoding as an option
- Added choice of different sampling rate and bandwidth for both transmitter and receiver
- Added callback to set coding rate and spreading factor of the transmitter during flowgraph runtime
- Updated documentation of each block
- Cleaned legacy unused blocks

# v0.2.0
 - Update to GNU Radio 3.8.2
 - Supports custom network identifiers/sync words
 - Improved message passing between blocks
 - Fixed bug for negative CFO

# v0.1.0
- Initial transceiver supporting 
    - Spreading factors: 7-12 (without reduce rate mode)
    - Coding rates: 0-4
    - Implicit and explicit header mode
    - Payload length: 1-255 bytes
    - Verification of payload CRC
    - Verification of explicit header checksum
