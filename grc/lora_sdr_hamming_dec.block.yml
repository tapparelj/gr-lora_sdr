    Hamming decoder using the correcting capabilities of coding rates 4/8 and 4/7.
    (As implemented now, we can detect errors with coding rates 4/6 and 4/5 but don't do anything with this information.)
        Input:
            in: Stream of bytes containing each a codeword
            CR: coding rate
            new_frame: indication that a new frame has started
        Output:
            out: stream of bytes containing ones nibble of payload each
