documentation: |-
    Compare two strings and write the number of bit difference to matlab/measurements/errx.txt as well as lost packets.
        This block expect one ref input every sent frame and will consider a packet as lost if another ref input is received before a msg input.
        The frame sending period needs to be large enough for the received frame to be decoded before sending the next one!
        This block is not very generic and therefore has to be modified in accordance to the experimentation procedure needs.
        Input:
            ref: a reference string
            msg: the received string
        Output:
            (optional) err: indicate that errors were present
